Project Proposal: Predictive Analysis of Ride Demand for Uber and Lyft in Boston, MA

1. Target Problem: 
The project aims to develop predictive models to forecast ride demand for Uber and Lyft in Boston, MA. By 
leveraging historical ride data, the goal is to enhance operational efficiency, optimize driver allocation, and 
improve the overall user experience. 

2. Motivation: 
Accurate prediction of ride demand is crucial for ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft to optimize 
resource allocation, reduce passenger wait times, and improve driver utilization. By understanding the factors 
influencing ride demand, we can enhance the effectiveness of these services in the dynamic urban 
environment of Boston. 

3. Data Source: 
We have utilized the publicly available Uber and Lyft dataset for Boston, MA, obtained from Kaggle. Link to the 
dataset. 

4. Data Description: 
The dataset contains 57 columns and 693071 instances. Some of them include: 
• Date and time of rides 
• Pickup and dropoff locations 
• Trip duration 
• Ride fare 
• Weather and temperature conditions 

5. Project Plan: 
• Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, address outliers, and format inconsistencies 
in the dataset. 
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify temporal patterns, geographical hotspots, and correlations 
between factors and ride demand. 
• Model Development: Implement Linear and Polynomial models such as Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet and 
models such as Random Forest and Decision Tree to predict ride demand for specific locations and 
time intervals. 
• Model Evaluation: Assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictive models using metrics such as 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 
• Dynamic Pricing Simulation: Explore the potential for optimizing pricing strategies based on predicted 
demand. 

6. Expected Deliverables: 
• Predictive models for ride demand in specific areas and time intervals. 
• Visualizations illustrating temporal and geographical patterns in ride demand. 
• Evaluation metrics demonstrating the accuracy of the predictive models. 
• Recommendations for optimizing driver allocation and pricing strategies.
